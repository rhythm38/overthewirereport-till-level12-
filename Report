----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 0 
Okay so in the beginning we use the command : ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
to connect the user bandit 0 to the host with name bandit.labs.overthewire.org and port number 2220 -p switch is used for port number.
Then on pressing enter it will ask for the password and as it is given in the question 'bandit 0'.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 0 - Level 1
Now we look for another password. For that we write the command ls -alps this command provides a list of all the files in the directory
so that we can find a readme file which contains the password.So after executing this we find a readme file and
to display its content we use the command cat readme. The cat command concatenates and prints whats in the file readme.
On executing this command we will get the password for the next level i.e. level 1. Now we switch over to another user named bandit1 
For that we first logout from this server by using the command 'exit'.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 1 - Level 2
Now we again connect the user bandit1 to host by the command : ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
and there we paste the password that we just retrieved from the readme file in the previous question. 
Now we again check the list of the files by entering ls -alps and find the '-' file.
And now to display its content we use the command cat ./- 
Executing this gives us our password. And so now we logout by using 'exit' command to connect to the next user that is bandit2.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 2 - Level 3
Now we again connect the user bandit2 to host by the command : ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
and there we paste the password that we just retrieved from the previous question. 
Now we again check the list of the files by entering ls -alps and find the 'spaces in this filename' file.
And now to display its content we use the command 'cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename'.
Executing this gives us our password. And so now we logout by using 'exit' command to connect to the next user that is bandit3.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 3 - Level 4
Now we again connect the user bandit3 to host by the command : ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
and there we paste the password that we just retrieved from the previous question. 
Now we again check the list of the files by entering ls -alps and find the 'inhere' directory. 
Then press 'cd inhere' to change our directory to 'inhere' and then press ls -al to list the content of this directory and
there we can see there is a hidden file there named .hidden.We can know if a file is hidden or not if it contains a '.' in the prefix.
And now to display its content we use the command 'cat .hidden'.
Executing this gives us our password. And so now we logout by using 'exit' command to connect to the next user that is bandit4.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 4 - Level 5
Now we again connect the user bandit4 to host by the command : ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
and there we paste the password that we just retrieved from the previous question. 
Now we again check the list of the files by entering ls -alps and find the 'inhere' directory. 
Then press 'cd inhere' to change our directory to 'inhere' and then press ls to list the content of this directory
Now to find the human readable file we press the command : find . -type f | xargs file , here find is used to search for a file/directory
'.' means search in current directory -type helps in filtering files and directories, f switch means files '|' is a pipe operator which takes 
the output of what is written before it and feeds it as input to what is written after it xargs helps to see if it is a human readable file or not.
And then where it is written ASCII text thats the human readable file,
And now to display its content we use the command 'cat humanredable filename'.
Executing this gives us our password. And so now we logout by using 'exit' command to connect to the next user that is bandit5.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 5 - Level 6
Now we again connect the user bandit5 to host by the command : ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
and there we paste the password that we just retrieved from the previous question. 
Now we again check the list of the files by entering ls -alps and find the 'inhere' directory. 
Then press 'cd inhere' to change our directory to 'inhere'.
We now execute the command : find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable, here find is used to search for a file/directory
'.' means search in current directory -type helps in filtering files and directories, f switch means file -size helps to justify size here c represents no. of bytes.
! executable means non executable
And now to display its content we use the command 'cat thtfile'.
Executing this gives us our password. And so now we logout by using 'exit' command to connect to the next user that is bandit6.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 6 - Level 7
Now we again connect the user bandit6 to host by the command : ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
and there we paste the password that we just retrieved from the previous question. 
Now to find this file we execute the following command : find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c here the user switch and group switch helps 
to mention a specific user or group we are searching for and '/' is for searching in entire linux system.
And now to display its content we use the command 'cat thisfile'.
Executing this gives us our password. And so now we logout by using 'exit' command to connect to the next user that is bandit7.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 7 - Level 8
Now we again connect the user bandit7 to host by the command : ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
and there we paste the password that we just retrieved from the previous question. 
Now we again check the list of the files by entering ls -alps to search for data.txt file.
Now we execute the command : strings data.txt | grep "millionth", here strings helps in encoding and decoding of base64 strings then its output is feeded 
to the command after | so grep "millionth" finds the word millionth in the file and then copy the password written next to the word "millionth"
And so now we logout by using 'exit' command to connect to the next user that is bandit8.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 8 - Level 9
Now we again connect the user bandit8 to host by the command : ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
and there we paste the password that we just retrieved from the previous question. 
Now we will first sort this data.txt file by using the command : sort data.txt
now we will find a unique line by using command uniq : sort data.txt | uniq -c, -c gives the count, Now the line with only 1 count is our password
We copy this password. And so now we logout by using 'exit' command to connect to the next user that is bandit9.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 9 - Level 10
Now we again connect the user bandit9 to host by the command : ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
and there we paste the password that we just retrieved from the previous question. 
Now we will again use strings command : strings data.txt | grep "=", string will encode the characters in data.txt and then | will feed its output to 
the input of grep and so grep will find the patern of "=" sign and this gives us our password.
We copy this password.And now we logout by using 'exit' command to connect to the next user that is bandit10.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 10 - Level 11
Now we again connect the user bandit10 to host by the command : ssh bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
and there we paste the password that we just retrieved from the previous question. 
Now we execute the command : base64 -d data.txt, here base64 helps to encode/decode to standard output and -d switch is used to decode therefore we get our password.
We copy this password. And so now we logout by using 'exit' command to connect to the next user that is bandit11.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level 11 - Level 12
Now we again connect the user bandit11 to host by the command : ssh bandit11@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
and there we paste the password that we just retrieved from the previous question. 
Now we first print the content of file data.txt and then we copy paste it to a website which uses ROT13 and then paste its content there and find its ROT13.
For example, cyberchef etc.
and then we copy its output and paste it when psasword is required for the next level that is level 12.
And so now we logout by using 'exit' command to connect to the next user that is bandit12.
